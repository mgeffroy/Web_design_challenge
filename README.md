# Web Design Challenge
## Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude) :computer::umbrella::cloud::sunny:
For this homework a visualization dashboard website was created using the plots of a past assignment that can be found [here](https://github.com/mgeffroy/Python_api_challenge). Specifically, we are talking about weather data.
In this dashboard, individual pages for each plot were created and also it is easy to navigate between these. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. There is a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
## Contents 
This repository contains the following: 
-***HTML files***: The list of all the HTML files created are listed below: 
 - ***index.html***: Has the information and format for the landing page.
  - ***data.html:*** Contains the table with the data source for all the plots and visualizations. 
  - ***comparisons.html:*** Contains all the visualizations side by side to be compared to one another. 
  - ***cloudiness.html, temperature.html, humidity.html, windspeed.html :*** Each has the plot for each weather variable and its explanation. 
  - ***style.css:*** Contains the style for some elements in the webpage.
- ***Images***:file_folder: :page_with_curl: Contains all the images used for the webpage. 
  - Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude (**N_vs_maxtemp.png**)
  - Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude (**S_vs_maxtemp.png**)
  - Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude (**N_vs_humidity.png**)
  - Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude (**S_vs_humidity.png**)
  - Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude (**N_vs_cloudiness.png**)
  - Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude (**S_vs_cloudiness.png**)
  - Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude (**N_vs_windspeed.png**)
  - Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude (**S_vs_windspeed.png**)
- ***Resources***:file_folder: :page_with_curl: Contains the csv with the data used for all the plots 
  - ***cities.csv:*** Weather data for each city.
